# Model Generation Scripts for the simulation of AP-PLY Composites
Python based pre-processing scripts to generate the models used to simulate AP-PLY composite laminates. For a full description of AP-PLY laminates, and a complete explanation of the modeling methodology implemented (in part) in this library, please see the accompanying (open access) paper: [Tensile response of AP-PLY composites: A multiscale experimental and numerical study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.106989)

## Summary
This library uses the Shapely package in combination with Abaqus' Python API to generate the geometries of novel AFP manufactured composite laminates, known as AP-PLY laminates.

## Usage
The use of this library requires the Shapely package, and an Abaqus/Explicit license.
