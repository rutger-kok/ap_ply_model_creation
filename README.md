# Model Generation Scripts for the simulation of AP-PLY Composites
Python based pre-processing scripts to generate the models used to simulate AP-PLY composite laminates.

## Summary
This library uses the Shapely package in combination with Abaqus' Python API to generate the geometries of novel AFP manufactured composite laminates, known as AP-PLY laminates.

## Usage
The use of this library requires the Shapely package, and an Abaqus/Explicit license.
